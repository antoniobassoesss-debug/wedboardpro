Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
WedBoardPro we are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and safeguard personal data when you use our services, including our website, platform, and related features (collectively, the "Services").
WedBoardPro is operated by António Basso, Avenida Conselheiro Ferreira Lobo 26, Lisboa, Portugal.
Contact: privacy@wedboardpro.com.
We comply with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and other relevant global standards.
Role Definition (GDPR):
•	When you upload customer content (documents/workflows) to our platform, you act as the Data Controller, and WedBoardPro acts as the Data Processor.
•	For data we collect directly from you (e.g., account signup), we act as the Data Controller.
2. Data We Collect
We collect only the data necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the Services:
•	Account Information: Name, email address, password (hashed), company name (if provided), billing details.
•	Payment Information: Handled securely by Stripe — we do not store full card details. Stripe processes name, email, billing address, payment card information (tokenized), and transaction data.
•	Usage and Technical Data: IP address, browser type, device information, operating system, access times, pages viewed, performance metrics, system logs.
•	Customer Content: Any documents, files, or workflows you upload or create on the platform (stored and processed in your Supabase project).
Note: We do not collect sensitive personal data (e.g., health, racial/ethnic origin) unless you explicitly include it in customer content (in which case you remain the controller).
3. How We Collect Data
•	Directly from you: (e.g., during signup, billing).
•	Automatically: via cookies, logs, and analytics (minimal; essential for operation).
•	From third parties: Stripe (payment confirmation), Supabase (auth events).
4. Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)
We process personal data for these purposes and under these legal bases (Art. 6 GDPR):
1.	Providing the Services, account creation, authentication, and support → Performance of contract (Art. 6(1)(b)).
2.	Processing payments and subscriptions → Performance of contract (Art. 6(1)(b)) and legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)).
3.	Security, fraud prevention, debugging, service stability → Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)), balanced against your rights.
4.	Improving the platform (aggregated/anonymized analytics) → Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)).
5.	Compliance with laws (e.g., tax, anti-fraud) → Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)).
5. Data Sharing and Subprocessors
We do not sell personal information (as defined under CCPA/CPRA) and do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted ads.
We share data only with trusted subprocessors under strict contracts (equivalent to GDPR Art. 28 obligations). Current key subprocessors:
•	Supabase (Supabase Inc. and affiliates): Database hosting, storage, authentication. Processes account info, usage logs, and your uploaded customer content.
o	Data location: Primarily in the region you select for your Supabase project (e.g., EU if chosen); may involve US processing under safeguards.
•	Stripe, Inc.: Payment processing. Processes billing/contact details and tokenized payment data.
o	Data location: Primarily US.
We may update subprocessors. Material changes will be notified (e.g., email or in-app) at least 30 days in advance where required by law. For the latest list, contact privacy@wedboardpro.com.
6. International Data Transfers
Data may be processed in the European Union, United States, or other countries (depending on your Supabase region and our infrastructure).
For transfers from the EEA/UK/Switzerland to countries without adequacy (e.g., US):
•	We rely on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (where certified), UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with supplementary measures.
•	Supabase and Stripe maintain compliant DPAs and transfer mechanisms.
7. Data Security
We use industry-standard measures:
•	AES-256 encryption at rest.
•	TLS 1.3 encryption in transit.
•	Hosting in ISO 27001-certified data centers (via Supabase/Stripe infrastructure).
•	Access controls, regular audits, monitoring.
No system is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security but commit to appropriate technical and organizational measures. In case of a personal data breach, we will notify you and authorities as required (e.g., 72 hours under GDPR).
8. Data Retention
•	Account and usage data: Retained during your active subscription + a reasonable period for backups/legal compliance.
•	Customer content: Retained only while your subscription is active.
•	Termination: Upon termination/cancellation, all data is permanently deleted within 30 days (unless longer retention is required by law).
9. Your Rights
You have rights under GDPR/CCPA/CPRA (where applicable):
•	Access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability.
•	Object to processing based on legitimate interests.
•	Withdraw consent (if applicable).
•	For CCPA: Know categories collected/used/shared, delete, opt-out of sale/sharing (we do not sell/share), non-discrimination.
To exercise rights, email privacy@wedboardpro.com. We respond within legal timeframes (e.g., 1 month GDPR, 45 days CCPA).
For EEA/UK users: You may contact your local supervisory authority if unsatisfied.
10. Children's Privacy
Our Services are not directed at children under 16 (or 13 under COPPA). We do not knowingly collect data from children.
11. Automated Decision-Making
We do not engage in automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects.
12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date. For material changes affecting your rights, we will notify you (e.g., email or in-app).
